There are several IRC channels on Freenode dedicated to IPFS, and it’s a great place for live chat:

- Use [#ipfs on irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org/%23ipfs) for general IPFS usage and community chat.
- Use [#ipfs-dev on irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org/%23ipfs-dev) for discussing implementation details, especially if you are contributing code to IPFS.

For longer-lived discussions and for support, please use the discussion forums at https://discuss.ipfs.io instead of IRC! It’s easy for complex discussions to get lost in a sea of new messages on IRC.
